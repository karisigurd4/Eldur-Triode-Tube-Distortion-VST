# Eldur-Koren-s-Triode-Tube-Distortion-VST
Eldur is a CPU-heavy distortion plugin based on Koren’s triode model—designed for tube-like saturation, crunchy warmth, and unapologetically high processor demand. Perfect for those who crave realistic tube breakup and aren’t afraid to push their machine to the limit.
